#Game Rules:
The rules of playing Simon game are quite simple. Here are the basic rules:

1) The game consists of a circular board with four large colored buttons. Each button is associated with a unique sound.

2) The game starts with a single color and sound. Simon will play a sequence of sounds, starting with one color, and then adding one additional color per round.

3) After Simon plays the sequence, the player must repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order as they were played by Simon.

4) If the player successfully repeats the sequence, Simon will play the next sequence, with one additional color added. The game continues in this way, with the sequences getting longer and more complex as the player progresses.

5) If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button, or presses a button out of sequence, the game is over and the player must start again from the beginning. 

Overall, the Simon game is a test of memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills. It's a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
